## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v24 or later recommended)

1. Installation

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

2. Local Development

    ```
    $ npm start
    ```

    This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

3. Build

    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```

    This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

4. Deployment

    The website deployment is fully automated. For more information, refer to the [Deployment](#deployment) section below.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `blog/`: Contains markdown files for blog posts. Blog-related metadata is automatically picked up by the Docusaurus configuration.
- `docs/`: Contains markdown files for documentation. These files are referenced in `sidebars.ts` to define the sidebar structure.
- `src/`: Contains custom React components, CSS, and JavaScript for additional functionality or theming.
- `static/`: Stores static assets (e.g., images, icons) served directly without processing.
- `sidebars.ts`: Configures the structure of sidebars in the documentation section.
- `docusaurus.config.ts`: Main configuration file for customizing and managing Docusaurus behavior.
- `build/`: Generated after running the `npm run build` command. Contains the static website files ready for deployment.

New content can be added as follows:

- Add new documentation files to the `docs/` folder.
- Add new blog posts to the `blog/` folder. No additional configuration is required.

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using a prepared GitHub Action workflow whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch.
